Get the submodules:

git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Running in Development mode

#### Configuration for Node

Copy and edit your .env file. -- This should never be committed to the repo.

```
cp sample.env .env
```

A short explanation of a complete `.env` file:
```
COOKIE_SECRET=A long, complex string for cookie encryption.
ASSET_HOST=Location of the javascript, css, fonts, and images that will be used by the designer and published assets.

S3_KEY=An access key for the S3 bucket listed above.
S3_SECRET=The secret corresponding to the specified S3 access key.
S3_OBJECT_PREFIX=String to prepend S3 objects. Useful for storing objects in folders. E.g. "level1/level2" => <bucket>/level1/level2/<filename>.
PUBLISH_URL_PREFIX=String to prepend to filenames that are saved on S3. Try use the URL that matches the protocol from which assets are hosted to avoid mixed content blockage.

Style Guide
-----------

### Introduction

The purpose of this Style Guide is to provide a single reference for visual styles and design elements used in Appmaker. 

The overall design approach is based on making building apps fun and gamelike. We want the site’s content and design to 1) encourage play and exploration 2) encourage non developers to think like programmers 3) enable anyone to build and customize apps that matter to them.

The visual guidelines outlined here are based on Appmaker’s fundamental characteristics, communicating a sense of fun, exploration, and play while building a space where developers and non developers can collaborate to create new and meaningful apps.
