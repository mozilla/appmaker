# Appmaker

Welcome to Appmaker (beta).

Appmaker is a tool that helps anyone, not just developers, create mobile applications.

Appmaker apps are composed of web components, custom/resusable HTML tags, connected with events and listeners.

To learn more about web components, check out the [Polymer Project](http://www.polymer-project.org/).

  * A [youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaRIdLgZTPI&feature=youtu.be) (that's already dated, but better than nothing).
  * [Appmaker -- why, what how](https://github.com/mozilla/appmaker-words/wiki) provides additional context about the motivation and use cases for the project, written before any code was forged.

## Getting Started

This section covers how to get Appmaker running locally. The workflow is optimized for contributors.

### Dependencies

Make sure you have `nodejs`, `npm`, and `git` installed.

`grunt` is required to run the test suite. To install grunt on unix and OS X,
run `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`.

We manage client-side dependencies using [bower](http://bower.io/). In order to add/remove these dependencies, you need to have `bower` installed globally on your machine, which can be done on unix and OS X via
`sudo npm install bower -g`.

### Forking And Cloning The Repository

Create a root `mozilla-appmaker` directory:
```
mkdir mozilla-appmaker
cd mozilla-appmaker
```

[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) this repository, and
then clone your fork into the `mozilla-appmaker` directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/<your username>/appmaker.git appmaker
```

Your directory structure should look like this:
```
mozilla-appmaker/
  ├── appmaker/
```

Configure remote:
```
cd appmaker
remote add upstream https://github.com/mozilla-appmaker/appmaker.git
git fetch upstream
```

### Environment Setup And Configuration

Install Node packages:
```
npm install
```

Configure your env:
```
cp sample.env .env
```

A short explanation of a complete `.env` file:
```
COOKIE_SECRET: A long, complex string for cookie encryption (NOTE: You define this for your local use, the string can be anything).
STORE: Storage approach for publishing apps. `local` is the default, `s3` requires additional environment variables (prefixed by S3_)
S3_BUCKET: S3 bucket name. e.g. "my.coolappmaker.com"
S3_KEY: An access key for the S3 bucket listed above.
S3_SECRET: The secret corresponding to the specified S3 access key.
S3_OBJECT_PREFIX: String to prepend S3 objects. Useful for storing objects in folders. E.g. "level1/level2" => <bucket>/level1/level2/<filename>.
PUBLISH_URL_PREFIX: String to prepend to filenames that are saved when publishing. Try use the URL that matches the protocol from which assets are hosted to avoid mixed content blockage.
PERSONA_AUDIENCE: The hostname and port of Appmaker used by Persona for authentication
PORT: The port that the web process listens on for incomming connections
```

### Start the Server

```
foreman start
```

or

```
foreman start -p <PORT>
```

If you need foreman:

```
sudo gem install foreman
```
